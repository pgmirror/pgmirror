### Master-detail relationships

This type of relationship has one row in the master table and zero or more detail rows in one or more other table(s). A 
foreign key that points to the master table can be annotated in its description with `@Detail` annotation.
For this type of hierarchy CRUD code for detail classes will not be generated. Persistence operations will be provided 
by the repository for the master class.

We are using a somewhat unusual approach with JSON as encoding for detail persistence and fetching. That way we can 
use a single round-trip for all data in this master-detail hierarchy.
  

**Example:**

An `Invoice` has one or more `InvoiceItem`s. Every `InvoiceItem` can have one or more `ItemTax` entries. 
Both `InvoiceItem` and `ItemTax` have `@Detail` annotation on foreign keys to parent table. 

Generated query for fetching a hierarchy in a `invoice -> item -> item_tax` relationship via JSON:
 
```sql
  SELECT row_to_json(master)
  FROM (
           SELECT invoice.*,
                  CASE WHEN count(items_detail) = 0 
                       THEN ARRAY []::JSON[] 
                       ELSE array_agg(items_detail.item) 
                  END AS items,
                  CASE WHEN count(invoice_compensation_detail) = 0 
                       THEN ARRAY []::JSON[]
                       ELSE array_agg(invoice_compensation_detail.compensation) 
                  END AS compensations,
                  CASE WHEN count(invoice_tax_detail) = 0 
                       THEN ARRAY []::JSON[]
                       ELSE array_agg(invoice_tax_detail.tax) 
                  END AS invoice_taxes
           FROM invoice
                LEFT OUTER JOIN (
                    SELECT items_detail_inner.invoice_id, row_to_json(items_detail_inner) item
                     FROM (SELECT invoice_item.*,
                                  CASE WHEN count(item_tax_detail) = 0 
                                       THEN ARRAY []::JSON[]
                                       ELSE array_agg(item_tax_detail.tax) 
                                  END AS taxes
                         FROM invoice_item
                              LEFT OUTER JOIN (
                                  SELECT item_tax.item_id, row_to_json(item_tax) tax
                                    FROM item_tax
                              ) item_tax_detail ON invoice_item.id = item_tax_detail.item_id
                         GROUP BY invoice_item.id
                        ) items_detail_inner
                ) items_detail ON items_detail.invoice_id = invoice.id
                LEFT OUTER JOIN (
                    SELECT invoice_compensation.invoice_id, row_to_json(invoice_compensation) compensation
                     FROM invoice_compensation
                ) invoice_compensation_detail ON invoice.id = invoice_compensation_detail.invoice_id
                LEFT OUTER JOIN (
                    SELECT invoice_tax.invoice_id, row_to_json(invoice_tax) tax
                      FROM invoice_tax
                ) invoice_tax_detail ON invoice_tax_detail.invoice_id = invoice.id
           GROUP BY invoice.id
       ) master
  WHERE master.id = 37;
```

Persisting such entities is done in layers: first the top-level entities are persisted, then one level below, etc. This 
is so that we get autogenerated keys that the lower-level entities need to refer to.

### Enums

Do Postgres enums have any value compared to lookup tables? This makes it a question of having enum values present at
compile time or loaded from the database.

### Lookup tables

Every application will have one or more lookup tables (not for enums but enums could fall under this category). Data 
that doesn't change often but is needed often. These tables can be annotated with the `@Lookup` annotation. Apart from 
the CRUD operations on these tables we can then generate code that loads data for all these tables at once. This can be
invoked on every transaction and can be improved with versioning so that the data is loaded on app start and then served
from cache unless some of it is updated.

### Events

Events are just normal tables that have a table annotation `@Event`. Events represent an immutable log of changes that 
were already done so the generated repository will not have any update or delete methods - only create and query methods.

We will not impose any structure on the event tables but some incrementing id and / or timestamp would be useful to have
there.

### Entity versioning

You can track entity versions by adding a `@Versioning` annotation on the column that will be used to
keep the entity version. Supported column type is `timestamp(tz)`. You can set the value for this column
any way you like, the generated repository will always ignore the set value and use `now()` for all `INSERT` and 
`UPDATE` operations.
 
### Optimistic concurrency (Version checking)
On a table that has a `@Versioning` column you can add a `@VersionCheck` annotation on the table-level comment. The
generated repository will have code that checks on update if the latest version in the table is the one that was used to
produce that new entity version. The return value for this operation will contain `Either` the `VersionCheckFailed` 
error or the success value.
 - **TODO**: work on this some more.
 
### Entity history

When a table has `@Versioning` and `@VersionCheck` enabled you can also add `@History` annotation on the table-level
comment. This will turn all `UPDATE` queries into `INSERT` and all queries will be generated so that they always select
the latest version of the entity. The table in question should have a composite primary key (identity+version).
